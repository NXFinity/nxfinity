# Project: ONE
###### 

---------------------------------

For over 5 years I've been researching this project, working on learning the various aspects of it from a 'Core' point of function. 
With always being the intention to release a **'Public'** stable **Opensource** version to work from, this included a fully functional 
frontend that would support the core development. But I've come to realise, that overlapping the two as a functional application, is no 
easy thing to try and do and so rather than keep delaying the project overall, the **Frontend** is being dropped from the project and I'm 
going to concentrate on perfecting the **Core Backend** structure.
